{\bf 07.12} \quad a) First, an understanding that the wording here implies that $X$ is actually "failures" of weapons. So the given $p$ would normally be $q$ in other contexts. So using the binomial theorem we would have $p = .05$ and $q = .95$. Knowing that we can use the Binomial theorem easily:
\begin{align*}
	\Pr \left( X \geq 1 \right) & = 1 - \Pr \left( X < 1 \right ) \\
	& = 1 - {n \choose 0} (.05)^0 (.95)^{n} \\
\end{align*}
We now solve for $n$ from the above equation knowing that the desired probability is $.99$ \\
\begin{align*}
	.99 & = 1 - (.95)^{n} \\
	\ln .95^{n} & = \ln .01 \\
	n & = \frac{\ln .01}{\ln .95} \\
\end{align*}
So n, since it must be an integer, is rounded to 90.
