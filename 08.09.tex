{\bf Problem 8.9}
Suppose that $X$ is approximately $\chi^{2}(m)$ and $S = X+Y$ is approximately $ \chi^{2}(m + n)$
and X and Y are independent. Use MGFs to show that $S-X$ is approximately $\chi^{2}(n)$:\\

First we have $M_{x}(t) = (1-2t)^{\frac{-m}{2}}$ and $M_{s}(t) = (1-2t)^{\frac{-(m+n)}{2}}$.
With these then we can get our MGF of interest, so $M_{s}(t) = M_{x}(t)M_{y}(t)$, finally then: \\
\begin{align*}
	M_{y}(t) & = \frac{M_{s}(t)}{M_{x}(t)} \\ 
	& = \frac{(1-2t)^{\frac{-(m+n)}{2}}}{(1-2t)^{\frac{-m}{2}}} \\
	& = (1-2t)^{\frac{-n}{2}} \\
\end{align*}
which is the MGF of $\chi^{2}(n)$ 
Thus $ Y=S-X $ is approximately $\chi^{2}(n)$.\\
