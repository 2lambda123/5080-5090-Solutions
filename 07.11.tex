{\bf 07.11} \quad  
a) First we need to know the $\mu$ and the $\sigma$. For a Uniform variable with $a = 0, b = 1$ we have
$\mu = 1/2$ and $\sigma = 1/\sqrt{12}$ (Note: it is not $\sigma^2$). We also need to know that $n = 20$ 
from there we can use the CLT: 


\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
	\Pr\left( \sum^{20} X_{i} < 12\right)  & = \Pr\left(\frac{\sum X_{i} - 10}{\sqrt{20} \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}} < \frac{12 - 10}{\sqrt{20} \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}}\right) \\
		& = \Phi \left( \frac{12 - 10}{\sqrt{20} \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}}\right) \\
		& \approx .9394 \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\\
b) We let $Y = \sum^{20} X_{i}$, let $Y'$ be our 90th percentile that we want to find. So we setup our probability as $\Pr (Y \leq Y') = .9$, $.9$ as we are interested in the 90th percentile. Using $\mu$, $\sigma$, and $n$ from part (a) we solve with CLT: \\
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
	\Pr\left( Y \leq Y' \right) & =
	\Pr\left( \frac{Y - \mu n}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} \leq \frac{Y' - \mu n}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} \right) \\
	& = \Pr \left( Z \leq \frac{Y' - 10}{\sqrt{20} \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}}\right) \text{Note: Z is standard normal due to CLT} \\
	.9 &=	\Phi \left( \frac{Y' - 10}{\sqrt{20} \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}}\right) \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
We now solve for $Y'$. We know (from a chart or list) that $.9$ from $\Phi$ is $z \approx 1.285$.
So we set our final equation for finding out $Y'$ with that in mind.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
	\frac{Y' - 10}{1.291} & = 1.285 \\
	Y'  & \approx 11.658\\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
